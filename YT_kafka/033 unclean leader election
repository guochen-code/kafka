** note it is on partition level:

unclean.leader.election.enable = true -> highly available, may have data loss
1 leader and 2 replicas, if 2 down, only 1 replica, it will be selected as leader, new message will come

unclean.leader.election.enable = false -> highly durable, no data loss
no leader will be selected, message will be stopped to publish into this parition
only when there are 2 brokers up running, 1 leader and 1 replica. in other words, there must be 1 replica. then will resume publishing data into this partition.

default value is true

- if in finance or banking domain, better to set this property to false
