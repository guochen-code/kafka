one of kafka's unique characteristics is that it does not track acknowledgements from consumers

consumer API you use (java or python) take the responsibility to commit the information in the consumer offset topic that up to the offset for it has consumed
all the information stored in : _consumer_offset
when a consumer is down, after rebalancing a new consumer start with the same partition (same consumer group),
it first goes to _consumer_offset this particular topic and will know 
where to start, prevents reprocessing of the same message

how to determine initial offset? (there is no offset, we just start first consumer in a new group)
- the decision on whether to consume from the beginning of a topic partition or to only consume new messages when there is no initial offset for the consumer group is
controlled by the auto.offse.reset configuration parameter on the kakfa consumer
- earliest: reset offset to the earliest offset. consume from the beginning of the topic partition
- latest(default): reset offset to the latest offset. consume from the end of the topic partition

***************************
once a consumer group has an offset written then this configuration parameter no logner applies.
if the consumers in the consumer group are stopped and then restarted, they would pick up consuming from the last offset.
