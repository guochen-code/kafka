configuration in the kafka producer internals for better cluster and production system

when a send method is called from a producer
(1) serialization and paritioning happens
(2) immediately the message never goes to kafka cluster, but rather it basically going to in memory queue kind of data structure which is acting like buffer
     or call this one as record accumulator

some import properties related to kafka producer

purpose of buffer: for efficiency in I/O operations and compressions

from buffer to kafka cluster, what operation takes the messages, basically there is an I/O thread

(1) buffer.memory
(2) batchsize
(3) lingerms (default=0, means message will be sent right away, which is not true due to I/O thread. it only true if I/O thread is free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
(4) max.block.ms

producing at very high speed. if buffer is full, send method is blocked for a particular span of time. use max.block.ms to configure the span of time.
for example 5 miliseconds. hope within the 5 miliseconds the buffer can send some messages to kafka cluster using I/O thread
and that way in buffer memory there is some empty space will be created and new messages can come in

***** summary:
sending messages too fast using producer API
- when the producer calls send(), the messages will not be immediately sent but added to an internal buffer
- the default buffer.memory is 32MB
- if the producer sends messages faster than they can be transmitted to the broker or there is a network issuem it will exceeds buffer.memory then the send() 
call will be blocked up to max.block.ms

if you write at very high speed, even if your lingerms=0, not expect immediately available to pass the message to kafka cluster
if the speed is not matching the I/O thread, suppose I/O thread is taking some time to write the message, obviously here in the buffer message will be keeping accumulated

experiment, send at a high speed

for i in range(0,1000):
     send(i)
# program very soon sent out all the messages and exit
# but in kafka consumer, only have seen 0-997, miss 998 and 999
# why: 998 and 999 not written to the kafka cluster, still in buffer, but program exit so I/O thread did not have a chance to pass them to cluster
# what to do:
producer.flush() # flush all the remaining messages in the memory buffer if any
producer.close() # close connection
