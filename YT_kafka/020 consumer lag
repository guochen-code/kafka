consumer lag: the difference between how fast producers palce records on the broker and when consumers read those messages is called 

*************** have 2 partitions
def custom_partitioner(key, all_partitions, available):
  return int(key.decode('UTF-8')%len(all_partitions) # odd number goes to partition 0, even number goes to partition 1
  
for e in range(1000):
  data = {'numer':e}
  print(data)
  producer.send(topic_name,key=str(e).encode(),value=data) # even number goes to partition 0, odd number goes to partition 1
  sleep(0.4)

there is bound to be some lag from the consumer, but ideally the consumer will catch up, or at least have a consistent lag
rather than a gradually increasing lag
