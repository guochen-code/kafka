broker is the key to connect between producer and consumer, so
need multiple brokers/ cluster of brokers to avoid single point of failture if only using one broker
how to manage multiple brokers, how to coordinate between multiple brokers if leading broker is not working
zookeeper

same idea
if single zookeeper, what if the zookeeper fails.
so, multiple zookeepers
make the whole system more fault-tolerant
