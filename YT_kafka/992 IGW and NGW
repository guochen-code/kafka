Internet gateway allows instance with public ip address to access internet
Nat gateway allows instance with NO public ip address to access internet
**************************************************************************************************
vpc is region specific
subnet is AZ specific
aws services located in subnet

vpc has a default main route table, which makes ec2-1 and ec2-2 communicate with each other even they are in different sbunets

public and private subnet
public subnet - own route table (add internet gateway) - internet gateway is to whole vpc - all ec2 in public subnet can access internet
private subnet - own route table - cannot access internet

ssh to ec2 in a vpc, need:
(1) internet gateway, attach to vpc
(2) route table, add internet gateway

vpc level 
IPV4 CIDR: 
10.0.0.0/16
1.0.0.0.1 - 10.0.255.254
10.0.0.0.0 -> network ip
10.0.255.255 -> broadcasting

subnet level
10.0.1.0/24
10.0.1.1-10.0.1.254

NAT: network address translation
(1) access internet, need public ip
(2) private ec2 does not have public ip
(3) require translation of private ip to public ip
Create NAT:
(1) need to be in public subnet
(2) need elastic ip address
Associate:
(1) private route table - edit routes - destination: 0.0.0.0/0, target: <NAT gateway>
