replication-factor = 3
ack = all
if one broker is down, the conditions will not be satisfied any more
either change replication-factor = 2 or ack = 1
alternatively, we can set:
min.insync.Replicas = 2
this will overwrite/change the meaning of ack = all

(1) 
if original topics is down (broker)
create another topic, write failed messages to this topic and consumer retrieve these messages and send to a producer, producer send to original topics once fixed

(2) if entire cluster is down
write messages to a database, scheduler code to retrieve these messages from db and use producer to send to original cluster once fixed
